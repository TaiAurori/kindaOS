# kindaOS
some sorta rust kernel i made in rust
(did i mention it's in rust)
# install/run
there's a `run.sh` script that should work if you have qemu

flash the precompiled binary in the github releases or the build result to a storage device you can boot off of and do some fuckin... bios shit to boot off the usb idk
# build
1. cd into the directory

2. `./build.sh`

(i hope)
